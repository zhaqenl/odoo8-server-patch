odoo8-server-patch
==================

This is a `process_python` function patch for the `server.py` file under the
`service` directory of an odoo 8 installation, for those that use `emacs` as
their text editor and those that develop using odoo 8â€™s `--auto-reload` option,
at the same time. Not applying this patch results in an uncaught `IOError` due
to emacs generating `*.py` files that start with `.#`, hence the file not being
found.
